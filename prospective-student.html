    <h5>Why join Band?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You form many friendships.</strong> The people who are involved in band with you are the people you see the most. So it is inevitable that you'll build relationships and friendships with them. And plus, you already have some things in common: you both know how to play an instrument and read music. Who knows, you may meet your best friend through band.</li>
            <li><strong>You make memories.</strong> Once you build your friendships, you make a lot of memories. They will be made while on trips to show competitions, during band camp, while other sections are practicing, and during concerts. You'll always look forward to what the band will do next, and after high school, you'll always remember those times.</li>
            <li><strong>You're given unique opportunities.</strong> All members of the Lion Band are taugh to make their best better. Their are numberous opporunities such as being a drum major or section leaders. Other opportunities for rewards include All-Region, All-State, and Solo and Ensemble competitions.</li>
            <li><strong>What happens at band camp doesn't really stay at band camp.</strong> What you learn during your Summer Band Camp will last with you for as long as you let it. You learn how to take instruction and criticism, you learn structure and patience, and develop great listening skills. What is taught to you in band camp can be applied to every day life, not just band.</li>
            <li><strong>It can build your confidence.</strong> Music is a greay way to express yourself! Performing, whether alone or with a group, builds confidence. In band, every single person is valued and an important part.</li>
            <li><strong>Field Trips!</strong> At the end of the year, the band travels with the other Fine Arts classes to different place. Past trips have been to Colorado Springs, Corpus Christi, and Branson, MO!</li>
            <li><strong>We will give you all the materials you need to be successful.</strong> Don't be afraid! The directors, drum majors, and section leaders are all here to help you every single step (literally!) of the way!</li>

The water your child drinks the night before is what gets him/her through the next day. Students should drink water throughout the day/night and at each break in rehearsal. It is especially important to drink throughout the day when school begins. Your child should eat before rehearsal. However, do not eat dairy products. Students tend to become nauseated during rehearsal after they have eaten dairy products. Eggs can also have the same affect.</p>
